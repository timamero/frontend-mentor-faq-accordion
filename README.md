### What I learned

Through developing a responsive and accessible accordion component, I gained valuable insights into front-end architecture. My initial implementation revealed a fundamental design flawâ€”I had been passing text content as element attributes rather than structuring it properly within the component. This realization prompted a comprehensive refactoring process that elevated my thinking about component architecture and semantic HTML structure.

A particularly rewarding challenge was implementing smooth height transitions between the accordion's active and inactive states. The solution I found was to set the transition on the max-height property. This project significantly deepened my understanding of both component design principles and animation techniques.

### Continued development

I would plan to evolve this project in several ways. First, I would enhance the Accordion component's reusability by implementing a more robust prop interface.

I would also restructure the CSS implementation using a methodology like BEM to improve maintainability and eliminate potential style conflicts. Additionally, I'll establish a comprehensive testing suite encompassing unit tests for component logic, integration tests for state management, and accessibility tests to ensure WCAG compliance.

### Useful resources

- [Accordion Pattern (Sections With Show/Hide Functionality)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/) - This helped me to improve the accessibility of the accordion component.
